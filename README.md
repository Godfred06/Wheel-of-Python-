# Wheel-of-Python-
This project will take you through the process of implementing a simplified version of the game Wheel of Fortune. Here are the rules of our game:  There are num_human human players and num_computer computer players. Every player has some amount of money ($0 at the start of the game)  Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game)  The goal is to guess a phrase within a category. For example: Category: Artist &amp; Song  Phrase: Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You  Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: _): Category: Artist &amp; Song  Phrase: _______ _______'_ _ ____ ______ ____ ___  Note that case (capitalization) does not matter  During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and: If the wheel lands on a cash square, players may do one of three actions: Guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed by typing a letter (a-z) Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost $250 to guess and can’t be guessed if the player doesn’t have enough money. All other letters are “free” to guess  The player can guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed and gets that cash amount for every time that letter appears in the phrase  If there is a prize, the user also gets that prize (in addition to any prizes they already had)  If the letter does appear in the phrase, the user keeps their turn. Otherwise, it’s the next player’s turn  Example: The user lands on $500 and guesses ‘W’ There are three W’s in the phrase, so the player wins $1500  Guess the complete phrase by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn’t ‘pass’) If they are correct, they win the game  If they are incorrect, it is the next player’s turn  Pass their turn by entering 'pass'  If the wheel lands on “lose a turn”, the player loses their turn and the game moves on to the next player  If the wheel lands on “bankrupt”, the player loses their turn and loses their money but they keep all of the prizes they have won so far.  The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed (or one player guesses the complete phrase)
